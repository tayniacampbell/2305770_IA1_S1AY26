    <h2>My Personality & Hobbies</h2>
    <p><strong>Traits:</strong> Kind, curious, and hardworking. These help me stay focused and positive in school.</p>
    <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Crocheting, Reading, Walking, Having study dates at cafes.</p>

    <h3>My Hero</h3>
 <p> I don’t have a role model/ Hero, instead, I focus on avoiding becoming like certain people. on a daily, I strive to embody the woman I aspire to be through intentional actions, such as choosing kindness, helping others, and upholding high standards, influenced by the ideals of a Proverbs 31 woman. This is my path to becoming a version of myself that I can be proud of </p>

    <h3>AI Business Idea Review</h3>
    <p>I read about an idea called “AI Personal Tutor.” It helps students learn better using AI guidance. It has been useful for my studies and friends whom i recommended it to, we have study dates using it. 
       One ethical issue is data privacy, but it can be solved by keeping all user data safe and private.

  <section id="development">
    <h2>Personal Development (Twelve Pillars)</h2>
    <p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong> Talks about setting clear goals. I learned that goals guide success, so I now plan to take baby steps daily because setting goals is easy but implementing them is easier said than done.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter 5:</strong> Discusses time management. I learned to use my time wisely and focus on important work as well as balance my time outside of school because father says all work no play will make you miserable, and im miserable enough as it is.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter 6:</strong> Explains the value of relationships. I try to support and learn from my classmates and friends. As I don't willingly involve myself in them i do take key notes from my friends, especially the ones in long term relationships. </p>

    <p><strong>Chapter 7:</strong> Teaches continuous learning. I stay curious and always try new skills to grow. I've never been able to sit still as a child and that led me to try and experience alot of new things so in a sense this has always been applied to my life. </p>
